# your Features Theme

Simply theme with sodakit -front

This is a bootstrap exercise from Kodilla.
I am rewriting this theme to sodakit frontpage boilerplate.

## Commands

`npm install` to install dependencies.

`gulp` for build task with watching changes, just build + watch task.

`gulp html` for pug building and concatenation to html.

`gulp css` for sass building.

`gulp js` for js building with eslint, babel end sources map.

`gulp imagemin` for image optimalizing.

`gulp clean` for delete dist catalog.

`gulp watch` for watch changes only, without deleting dist folder.

`gulp build` to run all building proces without watching changes and with delete dist
 folder before building.
